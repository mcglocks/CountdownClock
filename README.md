iOS app i've made that uses your current location to view the upcoming departures at the 5 nearest Subway stations to your current location. 
You can click on the train to get a detailed view of that trains path, in order to plan connections.

There is also an accompanying Apple Watch app, Watch Complications to add to your watchface, an iOS widget, and iOS Live Activities!
